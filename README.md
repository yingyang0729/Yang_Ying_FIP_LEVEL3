TODO: The repo is for level 3 FIP, which is finished by Ying Yang. In the repo, it contains all images, css file, html files, Sass files and JS files etc. 

## Installation
TODO: In the set up processing, it uses visual code for CSS and HTML5 and find ways on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). 
And the developer also uses [Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/ca_fr/).

During the processing of creating the CSS animation, Ying Yang checks many information. Those references include:[Images from JSON File in React JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWG1Ygt1k1k&t=398s), [How to fetch data stored in a json file ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6bLYYStZss&t=35s).

## History
TODO: 
The FIP project is finished by Ying Yang. I fetch the files with three ways, which are shown on HOME page, Graphic page, Motion Page. The last page is for emailing. As the only developer, I would like to explain the project.
1. Home: I finished the page with JSON and JS. I fetched all pictures and words by using JSON.
2. Graphic: I accomplished the page with JSONï¼ŒJS and Vue JS. On the the top of the page I added the Vue Router to attach pictures and text. I also used light box on the bottom of the page. 
3. Motion: I completed the page with JSON, JS and Vue Js. This way is learned from Professor Trevor's classtime. I used three ways to fetch files so I set up three JSON files.The video is controlled by JS. 
4. Contact: I have done the page with PHP, JS and Vue JS. It can send emails for any emails. I already fixed the problem. Now the contact page is working.


## Credits
TODO:  Here is a little problem.
 
 I checked my files after I post them on my hosting. I think the speed of my hosting is slow, so you cannot see some images.

The email is working. It is my test result of the hosting email.
